The results of my experiments are in the results folder.
<br/>
If you want to run the PhaseFive manually create a folder and give it a name.
<br/>Insert the template file created in the previous step into the folder you created.
<br/>The model must be called the folder.
<br/>Inside the folder creates two sub folders: default, uint8.
<br/>Enter two files in the respective folders, the ranking.txt file and the data.csv file
<br/>Then you can run the script with the command:

```
python script.py
```


Images with bar charts will be automatically generated and a report file called comparation.txt will be created
