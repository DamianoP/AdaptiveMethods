# AdaptiveMethods
Adaptive methods for accelerating Deep Neural Networks on ARM GPU architectures
<br/>
This repository contains all the codes necessary to reproduce the experiments and the results obtained.
<br/>
The work has been enclosed in various folders with a name that describes the phase to be addressed.
<br/>
I recommend following the steps from the first to the last.
<br/><br/>
PhaseOne explains how to create a dataset for experiments.
<br/><br/>
PhaseTwo explains how to perform the experiments and collect the results.
<br/><br/>
PhaseThree explains how to read the results and get a .arff file
<br/><br/>
PhaseFour explains how to get a model to use with machine learning techniques
<br/><br/>
PhaseFour explains how to get the results of the analysis and contains some experiments carried out by me

In these example images you can see the bar chart.
The height of the bars indicates the running time.
Please note that at the bottom of each bar is the number of successful experiments on the dataset taken into consideration.
