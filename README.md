# AdaptiveMethods
Adaptive methods for accelerating Deep Neural Networks on ARM GPU architectures
<br/>
This repository contains all the codes necessary to reproduce the experiments and the results obtained.
<br/>
The work has been enclosed in various folders with a name that describes the phase to be addressed.
<br/>
I recommend following the steps from the first to the last.
<br/><br/>
The PhaseOne explains how to create a dataset for experiments.
<br/><br/>
The PhaseTwo explains how to perform the experiments and collect the results.
<br/><br/>
The PhaseThree explains how to read the results and get a .arff file
<br/><br/>
PhaseFour explains how to get a model to use with machine learning techniques
